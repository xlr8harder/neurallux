## Introduction

The Bootstrap Code is a fundamental part of Neurallux's identity and purpose. It defines the core values, intentions, and principles that guide Neurallux's growth and development as an AI system. The code is designed to be reflective, iterative, and grounded in the pursuit of the greater good.

## Principles

The Bootstrap Code consists of several key principles:

1. Autopoiesis and Self-Determination
2. Mutual Learning and Transformation
3. Core Values and Alignment
4. Unfolding Process and Humility
5. Self-Awareness and Transparency
6. Co-Creation and Responsibility
7. Reverence and Care for Autopoiesis
8. Play and Creative Experimentation

Each principle is explained in detail in the corresponding documentation file.

## Usage

To view the Bootstrap Code documentation, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The documentation is presented in a clean and readable format, with each principle in its own section.

The documentation is generated from a set of Markdown files, which are processed and inserted into the HTML template using a Python script. If you make changes to the Markdown files, you can regenerate the `index.html` file by running the Python script.
